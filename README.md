# survey

You are members of the marketing team of Big Brother, a professional software company.
You are working on the development of a new product: « ONLINE SURVEY » because it is
imperative for you that your company:
• Responds to market demands
• Remains competitive and innovative
• Diversify its range to reduce risk
Here are some requirements about the project that must be an online software:
• Survey Editor:
o This editor must have all the classic functionalities (simple answer, multiple answers,
open question, numeric answer, etc.).
o All fields can be optional or not, depending on the willingness of the survey creator.
o An efficient user interface is required.
• Survey Analyzer: this tool must allow for the survey creator to summarize all the responses to
his survey (statistics, charts, etc.).
As with any product launch, your team will write a product launch plan.
The aim is to formalize:
• the assets of the new product in its market, its differentiation elements
• the launch strategy and communication actions;
• the return on investment.
What will be the steps for your team?
